# model — the Hartland TTR-M model

One model set (BM-2/BM-5), served over `pg-hartland-us` (USD) and `pg-hartland-cz` (CZK).

- `db/` — `model db`: the physical TPC-DS subset (facts + used dims), types, PK/FK.
- `er/` — `model er` + `er2db` binding: the 19 curated entities + relationships (05-d/D-5).
- `md/` — `model md` + `md2db`/`md2er` binding: the ROLAP star (cubelets, measures, conformed
  dimensions incl. the Product hierarchy Category→Class→Brand→Manufacturer→Item).
- `lexicon/` — `model lexicon locale en` + `locale cs`: the bilingual naming layer + valueLabels.
- `queries/` — the `q.hartland.*` preferred queries (#1–15, D-2).
- `binding/` — cross-model mapping: `er2db` (Stage 2.2) + `md2db` (Stage 2.4) `.ttrm` files.
- `connections.toml` — the two connection descriptors (`pg-hartland-us`/`pg-hartland-cz`).
  **Not a TTR-M construct** (the grammar has no `connection` def and no per-connection
  currency `unit` — verified against `packages/grammar/src/TTR.g4`): this is a repo-level
  descriptor Ariadne/Arges consumes at deploy time (Phase 3, plan-cluster.md H3). Both
  connections point at the *same* physical model (`modeler.toml`'s `[schemas.dbo]` handle) —
  the two databases are schema-identical (Phase 1); currency is a display fact carried by
  the lexicon locale (Stage 2.5), not a structural difference. "Loads clean and resolves
  against both connections" (the Phase 2 DONE bar) therefore means: the one model parses
  and resolves clean, and both connection descriptors target the identical schema — the
  live per-world round-trip is Phase 3 H3, not a Phase 2 blocker.

**Verify:** `just verify-model` (mocked parse/resolution unit tests, no live DB) and
`just resolve-packages` / `just check-model` (the tatrman Modeler CLI's deterministic
`resolved-packages.json`, same tool `ai-models` uses) — both run from the repo root,
borrowing the sibling `tatrman` checkout's built toolchain rather than vendoring one here.

**Packaging (Stage 2.2 finding — read before adding a new model/*.ttrm file):** the BM-9
tree groups files by model kind (`db/`, `er/`, `md/`, ...), which would normally give each
subfolder its own directory-inferred package, forcing an `import` in nearly every
cross-kind binding. Instead, **every model/*.ttrm file declares `package hartland`
explicitly** (first line, after any file-level comment), collapsing the whole model into
one flat package — same-package refs (`db.dbo.*`, `er.entity.*`) need no import anywhere.
`modeler.toml`'s `[packages] layout = "off"` suppresses the resulting intentional
directory/declaration mismatch; verified this doesn't block resolution (zero
`ttr/unresolved-reference` project-wide). One residual, accepted, non-blocking diagnostic
remains on every file — `ttr/package-prefix-divergence` — documented in `modeler.toml`.
**Also:** `date` is a reserved grammar keyword — don't use it as a bare attribute name
(hit this on `date_dim`/`inventory`; used `cal_date`/`as_of_date` instead). Entity-level
`aliases:` is deprecated (`ttr/lexicon-legacy-aliases`) — declare a lexicon `term` instead
(Stage 2.5). New accepted-residual diagnostic codes go in
`model/tests/project-harness.mjs`'s `ACCEPTED_RESIDUAL_CODES` (shared across every stage's
test file, not copy-pasted per file).

**MD calendar (Stage 2.3 finding):** the v1 calc-map catalog (`docs/features/md/map-
catalog.md`) ships `yearOfDate` as an EXTRACTION straight from `Day`, not a `Quarter->Year`
ROLL-UP (no such entry ships in v1 — only `quarterOfMonth` does). So `model/md/calendar.ttrm`
declares **three** hierarchies sharing the `day` leaf (`calendarMonthly`: day→month→quarter,
`calendarYearly`: day→year, `calendarWeekly`: day→week) rather than one Day→Month→Quarter→Year
chain — the pattern `docs/manual/en/15-md-model.md`'s own hierarchy section sanctions ("a
second hierarchy sharing the day leaf"). The MD "dot-path" drill notation
(`product.electronics.<class>`) named in the Stage 2.3 task list is unimplemented design-stage
sugar (`docs/features/md/dot-path-sugar.md`: "brainstorm output... Not yet a contract") — the
mocked test suite checks hierarchy-level resolution through the real resolver instead.

**md2db (Stage 2.4 finding):** `md/table-map-no-binding` is `scope: 'document'`
(`packages/lint/src/rules/md.ts`) — it only looks for an `md2db_map` in the SAME file as
the `def map`. All 4 Product table-maps ARE bound in `model/binding/md2db.ttrm`, just in a
different file than `model/md/product.ttrm` where the maps are declared — the rule's own
docstring says "Phase 3 refines cross-file", so this stays an accepted residual
(`project-harness.mjs`) even though the binding is complete; real completeness is checked
directly against the AST in `model/binding/tests/md2db.test.mjs`, not via this diagnostic.

**Lexicon (Stage 2.5 finding):** the task list's suggested `model/lexicon/value-labels.ttrm`
standalone file doesn't match how `valueLabels` actually works — it's a **property on an
existing `def attribute`** (er or md, both share `attributeProperty` in the grammar), not a
lexicon-schema construct with a `for:` target. `valueLabels` are attached directly on
`Product.categoryCode` (`model/md/product.ttrm`), `ReturnReason.reasonCode`, and
`DistributionCentre.dcCode` (`model/md/dimensions.ttrm`) instead — keyed on whatever the
physical value actually is (`categoryCode`: the stable English category string, same in
both worlds; `reasonCode`/`dcCode`: the `*_sk` integer, since `r_reason_desc` is already
localized per-connection and isn't a stable cross-world key). `desugarLexicon`/`foldId`
(`@tatrman/semantics`) are real, exported APIs — used directly in
`model/lexicon/tests/lexicon.test.mjs` for en/cs twin-parity and diacritic-fold checks
rather than reimplementing that logic.

**Queries + Shems (Stage 2.6 finding — Phase 2 close):** the `15-query.ttrm` conformance
fixture's own `search { keywords {...} }` pattern is itself deprecated
(`ttr/lexicon-legacy-keywords`, RS-32) — none of the 15 `q.hartland.*` queries
(`model/queries/q_hartland.ttrm`) carry it; Discover-chip triggering rides Stage 2.5's
lexicon terms instead. There's also no "language: MD"/dot-path query form in the
grammar, so the "md-derived" drills (#3/#4/#5) are literal SQL against the physical `db`
layer like every other query, not md dot-paths — consistent with Stage 2.3's dot-path
finding. All 15 were EXPLAIN-verified against live `hartland_us` (bonus, not part of the
mocked DONE bar). `agents/hartland.yaml` + both Shem overlays
(`agents/golem/shems/golem-hartland{,-finance}/shem.yaml`) mirror the real, schema-
validated `ai-models` agent-def shape and the `golem-ucetnictvi` assembled-Shem
precedent; checked structurally with `js-yaml` (also borrowed from the sibling tatrman
checkout — see `agents/tests/shems.test.mjs`).

**Phase 2 is done** — `model/tests/phase2-done.test.mjs` is the single-file roll-up of
the DONE bar; 53 tests pass across all 6 stages (`just verify-model`).
